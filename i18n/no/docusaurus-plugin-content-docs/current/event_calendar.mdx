## <h2 hidden>What is Event calendar?</h2>

The Event Calendar component in ILLA Cloud is a powerful tool for organizing and displaying events in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. It allows users to create, manage, and showcase events with ease, providing features such as date navigation, event categorization, and detailed event information. The Event Calendar component offers customizable layouts, intuitive event creation interfaces, and options for integrating with other systems, making it an essential tool for businesses and organizations to effectively manage and promote their events.

### Properties

#### Manual options

Add new options or delete options manually and configure the options one by one. The properties of options are as follows:

#### Mapped options

You can also add options from a data source by mapping the label and value properties to the corresponding data fields. You can get options dynamically from the database in this way. At the end of this article, we will demonstrate how to use it through an example.

### Use case

Next, we will demonstrate how to add new events displayed on event calendar with a button.

#### Step 1 Add an action

Let us create a table in Supabase called `events`. It has 9 columns: `title`, `description`, `resource_id`, `resource_title`, `all_day`, `draggable`, `resizable`, `start_time`, and `end_time` .

Then we can create a new action for Supabase from the action list, listing all the data with the code snippet below and called `supabasedb1.`

```sql
select * from events;
```

Change from `Run action only when manually triggered` to `Run action automatically when inputs change` in the upper right corner below **`Save`** button.

Click **`Save`** and **`Run`** to activate this action.

![event_data](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/event_data.jpg)

In order to add a new event, we also need another action. Choose the same Supabase resource from the action list called `supabasedb2`, and put the code snippet below.

```sql
INSERT INTO events (id, title, description, start_time, end_time, resource_id, resource_title, all_day, draggable, resizable)
VALUES ((SELECT MAX(id) + 1 FROM events), '{{input1.value}}', '{{input2.value}}', '{{dateTime1.value}}', '{{dateTime2.value}}', {{numberInput1.value}}, '{{input4.value}}', {{switch1.value}}, {{switch2.value}}, {{switch3.value}});
```

The input, numberInput, dateTime, and switch components are from the modal components. There are more detailed descriptions of those components below.

#### Step 2 Configure Actions

For supabasedb2, we want to show a notification when the new event info is successfully added to the database.

In the Actions, click `supabasedb2`, in the `General` page, scroll down to `Event handler`.

1.  Click **`+ New`** to add a new event handler.
2.  In the Edit event handler, select **`Show notification`** in action, **`title`** "Success" and **`description`** "Successfully add new event. Choose `Success` for **`type`**, put `{{2000}}` for the **`duration`** (2 seconds)

![event_action_success](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/event_action_success.jpg)

#### Step 2 Add Components

Next, we can add an **`event calendar`** component, a **`button`** component, and a `**modal**` component to the canvas. Label the button component to `Add new event`.

![event_layout](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/event_layout.jpg)

In the modal component, we change the text on the upper left corner to "New Event". We then add the `Title` and `Description` input components, `Start time` and `End time` date time components, `Resource ID` number input, and `Resource Title` input components, `All day`, `Draggable`, and `Resizable` switch components, and label them as needed.

![event_modal_layout](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/event_modal_layout.jpg)

#### Step 3 Configure the component

For the `**event calendar**` component, we can map the data from `supabasedb1` to display. We first choose `mapped` from options, then we put `{{supabasedb1.data}}` in the Data source and fill out the `Mapped Option` fields as shown below.

![event_data_source](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/event_data_source.jpg)

For the **`button`** component, we can configure it to open the modal when clicked.

1.  Click the **`button`** component to open its inspect page. Under **`Event handler`**, click `**+ New**`.
2.  In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, and select the **`modal`** component that you want to update as the target of the event.
3.  Choose the **`openModal`** method

![event_add_new_button](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/event_add_new_button.jpg)

For the **`modal`** component, we can configure it to refresh the events display in the `**event calendar**` when the modal is closed.

1.  Click the **`modal`** component to open its inspect page. Under **`Event handler`**, click `**+ New**`.
2.  In the Edit event handler, select **`Trigger action`** in action, and select the **`supabasedb`** component that you want to trigger for `Action name`. In our case, it's the `supabasedb1`.

![event_modal](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/event_modal.jpg)

For the "Cancel" **`button`** component, we can configure it to close the modal if clicked

1.  Click the **`button`** component to open its inspect page. Under **`Event handler`**, click `**+ New**`.
2.  In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, and select the **`modal`** component that you want to update as the target of the event.
3.  Choose the **`closeModal`** method

![close_modal](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/close_modal.jpg)

For the "Confirm" **`button`**, we want it to insert the new data filled out in the modal into the supabase **`events`** table and close modal.

1.  Click the **`button`** component to open its inspect page. Under **`Event handler`**, click `**+ New**`.
2.  In the Edit event handler, select **`Trigger action`** for action and choose `supabasedb2` for action name

![event_db2](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/event_db2.jpg)

1.  Click **`+ New`** to add a new event handler.
2.  In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, and select the **`modal`** component that you want to update as the target of the event.
3.  Choose the **`closeModal`** method

![close_modal](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/close_modal.jpg)

#### Step 4 Test

Now that we can test it as shown below.
