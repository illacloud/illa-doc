## <h2 hidden>What is ClickHouse?</h2>

ClickHouse is a fast, column-oriented database management system that is designed for online analytical processing (OLAP) workloads. It is an open-source project that was created by Yandex, the Russian search engine company. ClickHouse is known for its ability to process large amounts of data quickly and efficiently, making it an ideal solution for big data analytics.

With Illa Cloud, you can deploy and manage ClickHouse clusters on the cloud, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure and maintenance.

Illa Cloud provides a web-based interface for managing ClickHouse clusters, allowing you to monitor cluster performance, scale resources up or down, and configure backups and security settings. You can also use Illa Cloud to run queries on your ClickHouse data using a web-based query editor.
