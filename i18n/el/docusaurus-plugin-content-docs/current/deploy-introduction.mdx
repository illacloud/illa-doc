## <h2 hidden>Deploy introduction</h2>

### Cloud

Try one-click deployment in ILLA Cloud for the easiest experience.

### Self-host

You can self-host locally with ILLA CLI, Docker compose, k8s helm etc. We've repeatedly optimised the self-host process to enable you to make self-host and software deployments in just a few minutes. Compared to the cloud, you can use ILLA products more securely and reliably, and you can use ILLA Builder by simply visiting the deployment site after hosting and deploying Builder locally.

For more information on self-host, please see the ILA CLI, Docker compose, k8s helm boot pages.
If you have difficulties with your self-deployment, please contact us on GitHub or business@illasoft.com.
