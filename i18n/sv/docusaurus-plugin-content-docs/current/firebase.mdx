## <h2 hidden>What is Firebase?</h2>

Firebase is a comprehensive platform provided by Google that offers a wide range of tools and services for developing and managing web and mobile applications. It provides developers with a scalable and secure backend infrastructure, along with a suite of pre-built features and functionalities to accelerate the development process. With the integration of Firebase on ILLA Cloud, developers can enhance their applications with reliable and scalable storage solutions, enabling them to focus on building innovative and data-driven experiences.

### Create Firebase API

There are two ways to create a resource in Illa after signing into your Illa account.

-   Create in Resources

Sign in to your Illa account, select `**Resources**` on the top of the page, and click `**Create New**` button.

![external_resource](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/external_resource.png)

Select **`Firebase`** from the API list.

![action_list](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/action_list.png)

Connect to the database with the required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

After creating a resource, the ready Firebase will display as shown.

-   Create in Builder

Sign into your Illa account, create a project in Illa Builder on the `**App**` page, and navigate to the **`Action List`** at the bottom of the page. Click `**new**`, then select **`Firebase`** from the database list. Then, connect to the database with the required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

### Connection Settings

Here we need to provide information for connecting to Firebase API.

![firebase_config](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/intergration/firebase_config.jpg)

| Properties            | Required | Description                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name                  | required | The name for resource when creating actions in the ILLA.                                       |
| Firebase Database URL | optional | the endpoint or URL where the Firebase Realtime Database is hosted                             |
| Firestore Project ID  | optional | a unique identifier assigned to each Firebase project that uses the Firestore database service |
| Private Key           | required | a security credential used for authenticating and accessing Firebase services programmatically |

### Create Actions

We have created a Firebase resource, we can add the action by selecting Firebase from the action list and choosing the **`Create action`** button.

![firebase_resource_list](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/intergration/firebase_resource_list.jpg)

Now we have added the Firebase server as an action to our building page.
