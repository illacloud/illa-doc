# Multi-select

## Multi-select

The multi-select component can be useful in situations where multiple options need to be selected from a list. This can allow for more efficient data entry and filtering. The component can be configured with various properties to achieve different effects and also supports methods and event handlers for more customization.

You can add options manually or in bulk from your data source. In this article, we will introduce in detail how to use the multi-select component. 

### Properties

#### Manual options

Add new options or delete options manually and configure the options one by one. The properties of options are as follows: 

| Properties | Description                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Label      | The text displayed for the option            |
| Value      | The value associated with the option         |
| Disabled   | Whether the option is disabled for selection |

#### Mapped options

You can also add options from a data source by mapping the label and value properties to the corresponding data fields. You can get options dynamically from the database in this way. At the end of this article, we will demonstrate how to use it through an example.

| Properties  | Description                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data source | Set the data source of options                                   |
| Label       | Use {{item}} to set the label of options                         |
| Value       | Use {{item}} to set the value of options                         |
| Disabled    | Use {{item}} to set whether the option is disabled for selection |

#### Other properties

### Method

You can use other components to control the component. We support the following three methods:

#### setValue

To set the selected option, for example, {{[”value1”,”value3”…]}}

| Properties | Description                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Value      | An array of selected option values.  |

#### clearValue

To clear the selected options

#### validate

To verify that the input information is legal

#### clearValidate

To clear the validation message

### Event handler

We support listening to the onChange event of the multi-select component.

### Data

The multi-select component has some commonly used data, which can be called via {{componentName.propertyName}} in the app.

| Property name | Description                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| value         | an array of selected option values |

### Use case

Next, we will demonstrate how to use the mapped mode to dynamically obtain options. 

#### Step 1 Add an action

We have created a table named `selection`, including 5 columns: `options_en`, `options_jp`, `options_zh`, `options_kr`, `value`. We stored the option values in `value` and stored options label in different languages in other columns. 

Create an actions to list all data in `selection` named `postgresql1`

```jsx
select * from selection
```

#### Step 2 Configure the multi-select component

1.  Set the Data sources to `{{postgresql1.data}}` 
2.  Configure the label to change the label based on the language. 

    1.  Use {{ item.columnName }} to set the column. 
    2.  Use {{ currentUserInfo.language }} to set the language users use in ILLA.

    ```jsx
    {{currentUserInfo.language=='ja-JP' ? item.options_jp 
    : currentUserInfo.language == 'ko-KR' ? item.options_kr 
    : currentUserInfo.language == 'zh-CN' ? item.options_zh 
    : item.options_en }}
    ```

#### What’s more

You can add or delete options by adding or deleting rows to the selection table.
