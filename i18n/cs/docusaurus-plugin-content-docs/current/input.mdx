| Min Length              | specify the minimum number of characters that the user must enter into the input field in order for the input to be considered valid.                        |
| Custom rule             | Create your validation logic here. The rules should be made in JavaScript and covered by {{}}.                                                               |
| Hide validation message | You can hide the error message by switching the hidden status when the input value is incorrect. You can dynamically change the hidden status by JavaScript. |
| Form Data Key           | Specify a key of a wrapping form component when constructing the data attribute.                                                                             |
| Hidden                  | Dynamically control whether the component is hidden. You can change the hidden status through dynamical boolean value.                                       |
| Theme Color             | Allows users to specify the button's background color and opacity                                                                                            |

### Method

You can use other components to control the component. We support the following two methods:

-   **setValue**

To set the input value, for example, {{'value1'}}

| Properties | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Value      | Input value |

-   **clearValue**

To clear the value of the selected component 

-   **focus**

When the focus method is called, the input field will be highlighted and ready for the user to start typing without the need for the user to click on the input field

Example Usage:

Input component support listening to the `onChange` event of other components using built-in event system. Set it up by following these example steps:

1.  Add an event trigger to the component that you want to listen to. For example, if you want to listen to the **`onChange`** event of a Radio Group component, you would add an event handler to that Radio Group component.
2.  In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, select the **`Input`** component that you want to update as the target of the event.
3.  Choose the **`SetValue`** action and select the appropriate value for the input component. This will be the value that the input component has and will update when the event is triggered.
4.  Save the event trigger settings and repeat the process for any other components that you want to listen to.

Once you've set up the event triggers, the input component will automatically update whenever the **`onChange`** event is triggered on the other components. This allows you to create dynamic interfaces that respond to user input in real-time, making it easier for users to navigate and interact with your application.

### Event handler

| Event  | Description                                                                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Change | When a user changes the selected input value                                         |
| Focus  | When a user moves the mouse cursor on the input component                            |
| Blur   | When a user is done inputting value and quit from focusing on the cascader component |
