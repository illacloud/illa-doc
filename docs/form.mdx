## <h2 hidden>What is Form?</h2>

The form component is a visual element that represents the progress or completion of a task or process. It displays a horizontal bar that fills up or shrinks based on the specified progress value.

### Properties

### Method

You can use other components to control the component. We support the following two methods:

- **submit**

To submit the information filled in the form field

- **reset**

reset all input fields in the form component

- **setValue**

To set the text area input value, for example, {{"value1"}}

| Properties | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Value      | Input value |

- validate

To verify that the input information is legal

### Data

The component has some commonly used data, which can be called via **`{{componentName.propertyName}}`** in the app.

### Use case

We will demonstrate how to make a form with name and age as input, as well as bar progress to show the completion progress of the form.

#### Step 1 Add Components

Add a **`form`** component with the default text "Form" and a "Submit" button to canvas.

Add an **`input`** component, a **`number input`** component, and a **`bar progress`** component from `**Insert**` into the form.

Label the input component to be "Name", the number input component to be "Age" and the bar progress component to be "Progress".

Set the placeholder of the input component to "Please put your name here" and the default value of the number input to 0 as shown below.

#### Step 2 Configure the component

For the **`input`** and **`number input`** components, we can configure them to set the value in **`bar progress`** component to reflect the progress of completion.

1. Click the **`input`** and **`number input`** component to open its inspect page. Under **`Event handler`**, click `**+ New**`.
2. In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, and select the **`bar progress`** component that you want to update as the target of the event.
3. Choose the **`setValue`** action and set the value as

```jsx
{
  {
    input1.value && numberInput1.value
      ? "100"
      : input1.value || numberInput1.value
      ? "50"
      : "0";
  }
}
```

Note: need to set the event handler as described above to BOTH input and number input components.

For the **`button`** component, we can configure it to submit the form if the form is completed (ie bar progress 100%)

1. Click the **`button`** component to open its inspect page. Under **`Event handler`**, click `**+ New**`.
2. In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, and select the **`form`** component that you want to update as the target of the event.
3. Choose the **`submit`** method and put `{{barProgress1.value == 100}}` in **`Only run when`**

Similarly, we can configure the button to show warning when the user is trying to submit an uncompleted form.

1. Click the **`button`** component to open its inspect page. Under **`Event handler`**, click `**+ New**`.
2. In the Edit event handler, select **`Show notification`** in action, **`title`** "Error!" and **`description`** "Please fill out the form before submitting". Choose `Error` for **`type`**, put `{{2000}}` for the **`duration`** (2 seconds), and put `{{barProgress1.value<100}}` for **`Only run when`.**
