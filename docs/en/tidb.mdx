## <h2 hidden>What is TiDB?</h2>

TiDB is a database integration that allows you to connect and interact with a TiDB database. It is a distributed, horizontally scalable relational database management system that is designed to handle high-volume, high-concurrency workloads.

With the TiDB integration in Illa, you can query, update, and delete data from a TiDB database using SQL commands. You can also create custom SQL queries and run them within Illa. This makes it easy to build data-driven applications and dashboards that display real-time data from a TiDB database.

### Create TiDB

There are two ways to create a resource in Illa after signing into your Illa account.

- Create in Resources

Sign into your Illa account, select `**Resources**` on the top of the page, and click `**Create New**` button.

![external_resource](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/external_resource.png)

Select **`TiDB`** from the database list.

![action_list](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/action_list.png)

Connect to the database with the required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

After creating a resource, the ready TiDB will display as shown.

- Create in Builder

Sign into your Illa account, create a project in Illa Builder in the `**App**` page, and navigate to the **`Action List`** at the bottom of the page. Click `**new**`, then select **`TiDB`** from the database list. Then, connect to the database with required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

### Connection Settings

Here we need to provide information for connecting to TiDB database.

### Create Actions

We have created a TiDB resource, we can add the action by selecting TiDB from action list and choosing the **`Create action`** button.

![ti_resource_list](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/ti_resource_list.png)

Now we have added the TiDB server as an action to our building page.
