## <h2 hidden>What is Number Input?</h2>

The number Input component is a user interface element that allows users to enter and edit the number in a form or input field.

### Method

You can use other components to control the component. We support the following two methods:

- **focus**

When the focus method is called, the number input field will be highlighted and ready for the user to start typing without the need for the user to click on the number input field

- **setValue**

To set the number input value, for example, {{‚Äùvalue1‚Äù}}

| Properties | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Value      | Input value |

- **clearValue**

To clear the value of the selected component

- **validate**

To verify that the input information is legal

- **clearValidate**

To clear the validation message

Example: {{numberInput1.value}}

### Use case

Next, we will demonstrate how to map the data from the data source to number input with a button.

#### Step 1 Add an action

Let us create a table in Amazon S3. One of the documents is called

'111.txt' with the number '111' as its data. This is the value we want to show in number input.

![s3data](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/s3data.jpg)

Then we can create a new action for Amazon S3 from the action list, listing all the data in the bucket and named s31.

Select `Read an object` for `**Action Type**`. Put `111.txt` for `**Object Key`.\*\*

Click **`Save`** and **`Run`** to activate this action.

![s3output](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/s3output.jpg)

#### Step 2 Add Components

Next, we can add a **`number input`** component and a **`button`** component to the canvas.

We set the default value of numberInput to be 1 and labeled the button as 'Set value' as shown below

![default1](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/default1.jpg)

#### Step 3 Configure the component

For the **`button`** component, we can configure it to set the value in **`number input`** component to the data of the document we read from s31 api.

1. In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, and select the **`numberInput1`** component that you want to update as the target of the event.
2. Choose the **`setValue`** action and set the value as `{{s31.data}}`

![number_input_button_config](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/number_input_button_config.jpg)

#### Step 4 Test

Now that when you click the 'Set value' button, the value should change to 111.
