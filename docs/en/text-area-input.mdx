The Text area input component is a user interface element that allows users to enter and edit the the text area in a form or input field.

| Caption | A caption used to describe the field in detail |
| Hidden label | Set whether to display the label |
| Position | Set the position of the label relative to the component |
| Alignment | Set the alignment (align to left or right) of the label |
| Width | When the label is on the left side of the component, set the width ratio of the label. |
| Event Handler | Trigger queries, control components, or call other APIs in response to component events. |
| Disabled | Control the status of whether the component is disabled. The component cannot be modified or focused when it is disabled. |
| Read Only | Control the status of whether the component is read-only. A read-only component can be selected and focused but cannot be modified. |

| Hidden | Dynamically control whether the component is hidden. You can change the hidden status through dynamical boolean value. |

### Method

You can use other components to control the component. We support the following two methods:

- **setValue**

To set the text area input value, for example, {{'value1'}}

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Value | Input value |
- **clearValue**

To clear the value of the selected component 

- **focus**

When the focus method is called, the text area input field will be highlighted and ready for the user to start typing without the need for the user to click on the number input field

### Event handler

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Change | When a user changes the input value |
| Focus | When a user moves the mouse cursor on the input component |
| Blur | When a user is done inputting value and quit focusing on component |

### Use case

Next, we will demonstrate how to map the data from the data source to the Text area input with a button. 

#### Step 1 Add an action

Let us create a table in Supabase called `Project`.  There are two attributes in Project: `id` and `name`. The `name` is the value we want to map to our text area input.

Then we can create a new action for Supabase from the action list, listing all the data in project and names as `supabasedb2.`

Click **`Save`** and **`Run`** to activate this action.

#### Step 2 Add Components

Next, we can add a **`text area input`** component and a **`button`** component to the canvas. 

We set the default value of text area to be 'None' and labeled the button as 'Set value' as shown below

#### Step 3 Configure the component

For the **`button`** component, we can configure it to set the value in **`text area input`** component to the data of the document we read from supabasedb2.

1. In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, and select the **`textarea1`** component that you want to update as the target of the event.
2. Choose the **`setValue`** action and set the value as  `{{s31.data}}`

#### Step 4 Test

Now that when you click the 'Set value' button, the value should change to the names.
