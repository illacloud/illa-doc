## <h2 hidden>What is Airtable?</h2>

Airtable is a popular cloud-based relational database and spreadsheet platform that combines the simplicity of a spreadsheet with the complexity of a traditional database. It allows users to create and organize structured data in a user-friendly interface, making it useful for various tasks such as project management, content planning, and data collection.

### Set up your Back end on Airtable

Create an account on `Airtable` and create your base according to your need.

In order to connect your base to ILLA Cloud, navigate to the `developer hub`.

In `Personal Access Token` page, click `Create new Token`.

![air_create_new](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/intergration/air_create_new.jpeg)

This will open configuration options for the PAT that you are creating.

First name the PAT, then choose the scopes you'd like this PAT to have access to. Finally, choose what level of access this PAT will have.

Click the **`create token`** button, we now have a PAT ready to connect.

### Create Airtable in ILLA Cloud

There are two ways to create a resource in Illa after signing into your Illa account.

- Create in Resources

Sign in to your Illa account, select `**Resources**` at the top of the page, and click `**Create New**` button.

Click **`Save Resources`** to \*\*\*\*create a resource.

The ready `Airtable` will display as shown.

Click `**new**`, then select **`Airtable`** from the database list. Then, connect to the database with the required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.
