## <h2 hidden>What is Microsoft SQL?</h2>

Microsoft SQL in Illa is a database integration that allows users to connect and interact with a Microsoft SQL (MS SQL) database. MS SQL is a popular open-source relational database management system that is known for its speed, reliability, and ease of use.

With the MS SQL integration in Illa, you can query, insert, update, and delete data from a MS SQL database using SQL commands. You can also create custom SQL queries and run them within Illa. This makes it easy to build data-driven applications and dashboards that display real-time data from a MS SQL database.

### Create MS SQL

There are two ways to create a resource in Illa after signing into your Illa account.

- Create in Resources

Sign into your Illa account, select `**Resources**` on the top of the page, and click `**Create New**` button.

![external_resource](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/external_resource.png)

Select **`Microsoft SQL`** from the database list.

![action_list](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/action_list.png)

Connect to the database with the required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

After creating a resource, the ready MS SQL will display as shown.

- Create in Builder

Sign into your Illa account, create a project in Illa Builder in the `**App**` page, and navigate to the **`Action List`** at the bottom of the page. Click `**new**`, then select **`Microsoft SQL`** from the database list. Then, connect to the database with required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

### Connection Settings

Here we need to provide information for connecting to MS SQL database.

### Create Actions

We have created a MS SQL resource; we can add the action by selecting MS SQL from action list and choosing the **`Create action`** button.

![ms_resource_list](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/ms_resource_list.png)

Now we have added the MS SQL server as an action to our building page.
