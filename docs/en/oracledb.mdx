## <h2 hidden>What is Oracle DB?</h2>

Oracle DB in Illa is a database integration that allows you to connect and interact with a Oracle DB database. Oracle DB is a popular open-source relational database management system that is known for its speed, reliability, and ease of use.

With the Oracle DB integration in Illa, you can query, insert, update, and delete data from a Oracle DB database using SQL commands. You can also create custom SQL queries and run them within Illa. This makes it easy to build data-driven applications and dashboards that display real-time data from a Oracle DB database.

### Create Oracle DB

There are two ways to create a resource in Illa after signing into your Illa account. 

- Create in Resources

Sign into your Illa account, select `**Resources**` on the top of the page, and click `**Create New**` button.

Select **`Oracle DB`** from the database list.

![action_list](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/action_list.png)

Connect to the database with the required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below. 

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

After creating a resource, the ready Oracle DB will display as shown.

- Create in Builder

Sign into your Illa account, create a project in Illa Builder in the `**App**` page, and navigate to the **`Action List`** at the bottom of the page. Click `**new**`, then select **`Oracle DB`** from the database list. Then, connect to the database with required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

### Connection Settings

Here we need to provide information for connecting to Oracle DB database.
