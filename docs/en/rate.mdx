## <h2 hidden>What is Rate?</h2>

The Rate component in ILLA Cloud is a powerful tool that allows users to add rating functionality to their applications. With the Rate component, users can display a set of stars or any other custom symbol and allow users to rate an item or provide feedback.

### Method

You can use other components to control the component. We support the following two methods:

- **setValue**

To set the rate value, for example, {{‚Äùvalue1‚Äù}}

| Properties | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Value      | Input value |

- **clearValue**

To clear the value of the selected component

- **validate**

Example: {{rate1.value}}

### Use case

Next, we will demonstrate how to map the data from the data source to rate component with a button.

#### Step 1 Add an action

Let us create a table in Amazon S3. One of the documents is called

‚Äò1.txt‚Äô with the number ‚Äò3.5‚Äô as its data. This is the value we want to show in rate value.

![s3data](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/s3data.jpg)

Then we can create a new action for Amazon S3 from the action list, listing all the data in the bucket and named s31.

Select `Read an object` for `**Action Type**`. Put `1.txt` for `**Object Key`.\*\*

Click **`Save`** and **`Run`** to activate this action.

![rate_data](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/rate_data.jpg)

#### Step 2 Add Components

Next, we can add a **`rate`** component and a **`button`** component to the canvas.

We set the default value of the rate component to be 0, label it as ‚ÄúRate‚Äù, and labeled the button as ‚ÄúSet value‚Äù as shown below

![rate_layout](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/rate_layout.jpgÔºâ

#### Step 3 Configure the component

For the **`button`** component, we can configure it to set the value in **`rate`** component to the data of the document we read from s31 api.

1. In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, and select the **`rate`** component that you want to update as the target of the event.
2. Choose the **`setValue`** action and set the value as `{{s31.data}}`

![rate_config](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/rate_config.jpg)

#### Step 4 Test

Now that when you click the ‚ÄúSet value‚Äù button, the value should change to 111.
