## <h2 hidden>What is Redis?</h2>

Redis in Illa is a database integration that allows you to connect and interact with a Redis database. Redis is a popular open-source relational database management system that is known for its speed, reliability, and ease of use.

With the Redis integration in Illa, you can query, insert, update, and delete data from a Redis database using SQL commands. You can also create custom SQL queries and run them within Illa. This makes it easy to build data-driven applications and dashboards that display real-time data from a Redis database.

### Create Redis

There are two ways to create a resource in Illa after signing into your Illa account.

- Create in Resources

Sign into your Illa account, select `**Resources**` on the top of the page, and click `**Create New**` button.

Select **`Redis`** from the database list.

![action_list](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/action_list.png)

Connect to the database with the required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

After creating a resource, the ready Redis will display as shown.

- Create in Builder

Sign into your Illa account, create a project in Illa Builder in the `**App**` page, and navigate to the **`Action List`** at the bottom of the page. Click `**new**`, then select **`Redis`** from the database list. Then, connect to the database with required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

### Connection Settings

Here we need to provide information for connecting to Redis database.

| Port           | required | The server host's port number that you should use to connect. If you don't specify a port, the default port is '6379'. |
| Database Index | optional | a data structure that is used to optimize the performance of queries that retrieve data from a Redis database          |
| Database       | required | The name of the database                                                                                               |

| SSL options    | optional | decides how high a secure SSL TCP/IP connection is prioritized while negotiating with the server.                      |

### Create Actions

We have created a Redis resource, we can add the action by selecting Redis from action list and choosing the **`Create action`** button.

![redis_resource_list](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/redis_resource_list.png)

Now we have added the Redis server as an action to our building page.

### Configure Redis

| Properties  | Description                                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| query       | commands to retrieve data from database                    |
| Transformer | transforming data into the style you like using JavaScript |

Example usage:

- KEYS

This command retrieves a list of all keys in the Redis database. You can use wildcards to filter the keys by pattern.

```sql
KEYS *
KEYS user:*
```

- GET

This command retrieves the value associated with a given key.

```sql
GET user:12345
```

- HGETALL

This command retrieves all fields and their values from a Redis hash data structure.

```sql
HGETALL user:12345
```

- ZRANGE

This command retrieves a range of values from a Redis sorted set data structure, based on their scores.

```sql
ZRANGE high_scores 0 9 WITHSCORES
```

- LRANGE

This command retrieves a range of values from a Redis list data structure.

```sql
LRANGE my_list 0 4
```

- EXISTS

This command checks if a given key exists in the Redis database.

```sql
EXISTS user:12345
```

- TTL

This command retrieves the time-to-live (TTL) value associated with a key, which specifies how long the key will remain in the database before it expires.

```sql
TTL user:12345
```
