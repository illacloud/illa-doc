## <h2 hidden>Known Issues</h2>
### Mount Type Issue

RunÂ `illa deploy --self -port=1000 -s={your-ip-address}`Â orÂ `run-official-image.sh`, return following error:

`Docker responded with status code 400: invalid mount config for type "bind": bind source path does not exist: /tmp/illa-data`

For now, the mount type only supportsÂ `mount`, please configÂ `docker -v`Â asÂ `mount`Â mode. Or reinstall the docker by following scripts.

[reinstall-docker-with-ubuntu.sh](https://github.com/illacloud/deploy-illa-manually/blob/main/utils/reinstall-docker-with-ubuntu.sh)

And run the deploy command again.
