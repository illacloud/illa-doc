## <h2 hidden>What is MariaDB?</h2>

MariaDB in Illa is a database integration that allows you to connect and interact with a MariaDB database. MariaDB is a popular open-source relational database management system that is derived from MySQL.

With the MariaDB integration, you can query, insert, update, and delete data from a MariaDB database using SQL commands. You can also create custom SQL queries and run them within Illa. This makes it easy to build data-driven applications and dashboards that display real-time data from a MariaDB database.

### Create MariaDB

There are two ways to create a resource in Illa after signing into your Illa account. 

- Create in Resources

Sign into your Illa account, select `**Resources**` on the top of the page, and click `**Create New**` button.

Select **`MariaDB`** from the database list.

Connect to the database with the required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below. 

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

After creating a resource, the ready MariaDB will display as shown.

- Create in Builder

Sign into your Illa account, create a project in Illa Builder in the `**App**` page, and navigate to the **`Action List`** at the bottom of the page. Click `**new**`, then select **`MariaDB`** from the database list. Then, connect to the database with required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.
