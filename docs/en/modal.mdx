## <h2 hidden>What is Modal?</h2>

In ILLA Cloud, the modal component is a user interface element that is used to display content, information, or actions in a focused and overlayed window. The modal component typically appears on top of the main application screen, temporarily interrupting the user's workflow and drawing their attention to the modal content.

### Method

You can use other components to control the component. We support the following two methods:

- openModal

open the modal component

- closeModal

close the modal component

### Use case

We will demonstrate how to make a form with name and age as input, as well as bar progress to show the completion progress of the form.

#### Step 1 Add Components

Add a **`button`** component labeled "Open Modal"

Add a modal component to the canvas.

#### Step 2 Configure the component

For the "Open Modal" **`button`** components, we can configure it to open the **`modal`** component if clicked.

1. Click the **`button`** component to open its inspect page. Under **`Event handler`**, click `**+ New**`.
2. In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, and select the **`modal`** component that you want to update as the target of the event.
3. Choose the **`openModal`** method

Click this button to open the modal component and you may put whatever you want in the middle area of the modal.

For the "Cancel" **`button`** component, we can configure it to close the modal if clicked

1. Click the **`button`** component to open its inspect page. Under **`Event handler`**, click `**+ New**`.
2. In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, and select the **`modal`** component that you want to update as the target of the event.
3. Choose the **`closeModal`** method

Similarly, we can configure the "Confirm" button to congrats

1. Click the **`button`** component to open its inspect page. Under **`Event handler`**, click `**+ New**`.
2. In the Edit event handler, select **`Show notification`** in action, **`title`** "Congrat!" and **`description`** "Congratulations!". Choose `Success` for **`type`**, put `{{2000}}` for the **`duration`** (2 seconds)
