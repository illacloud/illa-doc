## <h2 hidden>What is Editable Text?</h2>

Editable text allows users to create and manipulate text within their applications. With this component, users can easily input and edit text directly on the interface, making it ideal for creating dynamic and interactive content.

### Properties

### Method

You can use other components to control the component. We support the following five methods:

- **setValue**

To set the text area input value, for example, {{"value1"}}

| Properties | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Value      | Input value |

- **clearValue**

To clear the value of the selected component

- **focus**

When the focus method is called, the text area input field will be highlighted and ready for the user to start typing without the need for the user to click on the number input field

- **validate**

To verify that the input information is legal

- **clearValidate**

To clear the validation message

### Event handler

| Event  | Description                                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Change | When a user changes the input value                                |
| Focus  | When a user moves the mouse cursor on the input component          |
| Blur   | When a user is done inputting value and quit focusing on component |

Example: {{editable_text1.value}}

### Use case

Next, we will demonstrate how to map the data from the data source to the editable text with a button.

#### Step 1 Add an action

Let us create a table in REST API with columns `id`, `name`, and `age`. The id 1 document is what we want to show in the form component.

![rest_get_all](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/rest_get_all.jpg)

Then we can create a new action for REST API from the action list in the app we want to build, listing all the data in the bucket and named restapi1.

Select `GET` for `**Action Type**`. In URL Parameters, put `id` for key and `1` for value**.**

Click **`Save`** and **`Run`** to activate this action.

![rest_get_1](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/rest_get_1.jpg)

#### Step 2 Add Components

Next, we can add an **`editable text`** component and a **`button`** component to the canvas.

We label editable text to be 'Name' and labeled the button as "Set value" as shown below

![edit_layout](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/edit_layout.jpg)

#### Step 3 Configure the component

For the **`button`** component, we can configure it to set the value in **`editable text`** component to the data of the document we read from restapi.

1. In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, and select the **`editable text`** component that you want to update as the target of the event.
2. Choose the **`setValue`** action and set the value as `{{restapi1.data[0]["name"]}}`

![edit_event_config](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/edit_event.jpg)

#### Step 4 Test

Now that when you click the "Set value" button, the value should change to the text.
