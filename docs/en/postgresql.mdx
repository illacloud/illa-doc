## <h2 hidden>What is PostgreSQL?</h2>

PostgreSQL in Illa is a database integration that allows you to connect and interact with a PostgreSQL database. PostgreSQL is a popular open-source relational database management system that is known for its stability, reliability, and powerful features.

With the PostgreSQL integration in Illa, you can query, insert, update, and delete data from a PostgreSQL database using SQL commands. You can also create custom SQL queries and run them within Illa action. This makes it easy to build data-driven applications and dashboards that display real-time data from a PostgreSQL database.

### Create PostgreSQL

There are two ways to create a resource in Illa after signing into your Illa account.

- Create in Resources

Sign into your Illa account, select `**Resources**` on the top of the page, and click `**Create New**` button.

Select **`PostgreSQL`** from the database list.

![action_list](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/action_list.png)

Connect to the database with required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

After creating a resource, the ready PostgreSQL will display as shown.

- Create in Builder

Sign into your Illa account, create a project in Illa Builder in the `**App**` page, and navigate to the **`Action List`** at the bottom of the page. Click `**new**`, then select **`PostgreSQL`** from the database list. Then, connect to the database with required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

### Connection Settings

We have created a PostgreSQL resource, we can add the action by selecting PostgreSQL from action list and choosing the **`Create action`** button.

![post_resource_list](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/post_resource_list.png)

Now we have added the PostgreSQL server as an action to our building page.

### Configure PostgreSQL

| Properties  | Description                                                               |

Example usage:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY lastname;
```

- Insert

```sql

	(firstname, lastname, email)

VALUES

	(

		{{ NewUser.data.firstNameInput }},

		{{ NewUser.data.lastNameInput }},

		{{ NewUser.data.emailInput }}

	);
```

```sql
UPDATE users
  SET firstname = '{{form1.updatedProfile.first}}'
  WHERE id = {{ form1.updatedProfile.uid}};
```

- Delete
