## <h2 hidden>What is Switch?</h2>

The Switch component is a user interface element that allows users to toggle between two states: "on" and "off".

### Properties

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Default value | The initial value of the component. You can dynamically change the initial value by typing JavaScript in {{}}. |
| Label | The name of the field displayed to the user |
| Caption | A caption used to describe the field in detail |
| Hidden label | Set whether to display the label |
| Position | Set the position of the label relative to the component |
| Alignment | Set the alignment of the label |
| Event Handler | Trigger queries, control components, or call other APIs in response to component events. |
| Loading | Whether the component should show a loading indicator. |
| Disabled | Control the status of whether the component is disabled. The component cannot be modified or focused when it is disabled. |
| Tooltip | User can enter component tooltip here. The tooltip will be shown when it is focused. Markdown format is supported. |
| Hidden | Dynamically control whether the component is hidden. You can change the hidden status through dynamical boolean value. |
| Theme Color | Allows users to specify the button's background color and opacity |

### Method

You can use other components to control the component. We support the following three methods:

- **setValue**

To set the selected value, for example, {{'value1'}}

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Value | Selected value |
- **clearValue**

To clear the selected value

- **toggle**

changing the switch from the "off" state to the "on" state, or vice versa

Example Usage:

Switch component support listening to the `onClick` event of other components using built-in event system. Set it up by following these example steps:

1. Add an event trigger to the component that you want to listen to. For example, if you want to listen to the **`onClick`** event of a Button component, you would add an event trigger to that Button component.
2. In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, select the **`Switch`** component that you want to update as the target of the event.
3. Choose the **`toggle`** action. When the event is triggered (ie when the button is clicked), the switch component with be toggled and its status will be updated.
4. Save the event trigger settings and repeat the process for any other components that you want to listen to.

Once you've set up the event triggers, the switch component will automatically update whenever the **`onClick`** event is triggered on the other components. This allows you to create dynamic interfaces that respond to user input in real-time, making it easier for users to navigate and interact with your application.

### Event handler

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Change | When a user changes the selected option value, perform specific action customized by users. |

### Data

The button component has some commonly used data, which can be called via **`{{componentName.propertyName}}`** in the app.

| Property name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| colorScheme | background color of the button |
| displayName | the name of this component (ie button1) |
| hidden | a boolean value indicate the hidden status of button |
| label | label value |
| labelAlign | alignment of switch label (left or right) |
| labelPosition | position of switch label (left or right) |
| labelWidth | the integer representing width of label. |
| labelFull | a Boolean value indicate if the label is full. |
| value | A user sets the value to be true or false  |

### Use case

Next, we will demonstrate how to switch the status of other components dynamically. 

#### Step 1 Add a Component

First we add the **`Switch`** component and label it as 'Hide'. Then we use the **`text`** component as an influenced component that changes from 'displayed' to 'hidden' state. We change its content to 'Hello World' 

#### Step 2 Configure a Component

In the **`Hidden`** property for Text. Click on the **`fx`** icon so we can control the component's hidden state by setting it the same as the value of our switch using JavaScript:

```jsx
{{switch1.value}}
```

Now, whenever the switch is on, the value for switch is **`true`,** the text will be hide, and vice versa.

 

Switch **`On`**
