## <h2 hidden>What is Divider?</h2>

In ILLA Cloud, the divider component is a visual element that helps to separate or divide sections of content within a web application. It is a simple horizontal line or vertical line that can be inserted between different sections or components to improve the visual organization and clarity of the user interface.
